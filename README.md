# Pokemon Card Investment Portfolio üÉè

With the emergence of the new Pokemon App and the growing popularity of the franchise, Pokemon has reached its peak in 2024. The latest card collections have become increasingly expensive, as many people seek to profit from collecting them, turning these cards into genuine investment assets.
This project aims to create an investment portfolio for Pok√©mon cards by leveraging historical price trends and financial modeling. The main objective is to execute all key steps of a data science project, from data scraping and analysis to statistical modelling, culminating in the visualisation and presentation of results.

Here is the structure of the project : 






# 1. Data Extraction

- Scrape Pok√©mon card prices and historical sales data from TCGPlayer.

- Focus on the "Near Mint Comparison Prices" table to identify the most valuable card variants (e.g., Holofoil, Reverse Holofoil).
- Extract and organize price history data into structured CSV files.
